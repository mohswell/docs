## Introduction
### Environment Configuration Explained 

Environment configuration is about managing the settings and variables that change between machines and environments (for example: `development`, `staging`, and `CI`). Properly configuring your environment makes tests reliable and portable across local development and CI runs.


### Environment Configuration Explained 

Environment variables let you parameterize tests (base URLs, feature flags, timeouts, and non-sensitive credentials). Common practices:

- Use `.env` files for local development and a secrets store or CI environment variables for private values — never commit secrets to source control.
- Load local variables with `dotenv` during development, or wire them into Playwright's config (for example: `use: { baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL }`).
- Prefer explicit fixture-based patterns for per-test setup (fixtures make it clear what state a test depends on and make tests easier to share).
